= 3.3 Verifying the Mock API
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that ArgoCD has successfully deployed the mock API application, let's perform a few tests to ensure it's running and serving data correctly. We will use the built-in OpenShift command line terminal, which provides a convenient way to interact with our project without leaving the web console.

== Accessing the OpenShift Web Terminal

1.  In the OpenShift web console, make sure you are in the **Developer** perspective and have your project (`{user}`) selected.

2.  If you have closed it, open the command line terminal by clicking the terminal icon in the top-right corner of the page.

3.  A new browser tab will open with a terminal session already logged into your OpenShift account and pointing to your project.

== Testing the API Endpoints

We will now send requests to two of the API's endpoints: `/api/v1/health` for a simple status check, and `/api/v1/incidents` to retrieve sample data. The API is exposed internally via a Kubernetes Service named `mock-api` on port `8080`.

1.  **Perform a Health Check:** In the OpenShift terminal, run the following command to check the health endpoint.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://mock-servicenow-api-svc.{user}.svc.cluster.local:8080/api/v1/health
----
+
You should see the following JSON output, indicating that the API is up and running:
+
[source,json]
----
{"status":"UP"}
----

2.  **Fetch Incident Data:** Now, let's query the main data endpoint to see the mock ticket data. This is the same endpoint our pipeline will use. We'll ask for two "closed" incidents and pipe the output to the `jq` utility to format it nicely.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl 'http://mock-servicenow-api-svc.{user}.svc.cluster.local:8080/api/v1/incidents?state=closed&limit=2' | jq
----

3.  The output should be a well-formatted JSON object containing a `result` array with two incident records, similar to the example below.

      "closed_at": "...",

    }
  ],

If you see this output, it confirms that the mock API is fully functional. We are now ready to deploy the Milvus database.
