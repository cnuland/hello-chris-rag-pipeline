= 2.1 Demo: Real-time PDF Processing
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this section, your workshop instructor will demonstrate the fully automated, event-driven pipeline that was built as part of the prototype. This workflow showcases how we can ingest unstructured documents, like technical manuals in PDF format, in real-time.

The goal is to show how a simple action—uploading a file—can trigger a complex, multi-step data processing workflow without any manual intervention.

== Architecture of the Event-Driven Pipeline

Let's quickly review the architecture of the workflow we are about to see.

**The flow is as follows:**

1.  A user uploads a PDF file to a **MinIO S3 bucket**.
2.  MinIO immediately sends an event notification to an **Apache Kafka** topic.
3.  A **Knative KafkaSource** consumes the message from Kafka and converts it into a standard CloudEvent.
4.  The CloudEvent is sent to the **Knative Broker**.
5.  A **Knative Trigger** filters for this specific event type and invokes the `s3-event-handler` target.
6.  The `s3-event-handler`, a serverless function, receives the event and launches a **Kubeflow Pipeline**.
7.  The Kubeflow Pipeline runs a component using the **Docling** library to parse the PDF.

The instructor will now perform the demo, and we will trace the event through each step of this process.

== Step 1: Uploading a PDF to MinIO

The entire process begins by uploading a file to our S3 bucket, `pdf-inbox`.

1.  First, the instructor will navigate to the MinIO console using the OpenShift route.
2.  They will log in using the credentials for the MinIO instance.
3.  Next, they will navigate to the `pdf-inbox` bucket.
4.  Finally, they will upload a sample PDF document, such as `scripts/event-test-20250601-212930.pdf` from our Git repository.

As soon as the upload is complete, the MinIO server fires an event.

== Step 2: Observing the Event in Kafka

The `minio-event-bridge` service receives the webhook from MinIO and immediately publishes a message to our Kafka topic, `minio-events`. We can see this message in real-time by running a console consumer from inside the Kafka cluster.

The instructor will run the following command to see the event appear in the topic:

```bash
# This command connects to our Kafka cluster and listens to the 'minio-events' topic
oc exec -n kafka <your-kafka-broker-pod-name> -- bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
    --topic minio-events --from-beginning --timeout-ms 15000
```

The audience will see the raw JSON event from MinIO appear on the screen, confirming it has been successfully brokered by Kafka.

== Step 3: From Kafka to Knative

Now, we will see how Knative Eventing picks up the event.

1.  **Knative KafkaSource:** This component is continuously polling the `minio-events` Kafka topic. The instructor will show the logs of the KafkaSource pod.
    ```bash
    # Get the name of the KafkaSource pod in the workshop namespace
    oc get pods -n rag-pipeline-workshop -l eventing.knative.dev/source=minio-kafka-source

    # View the logs of the dispatcher container within that pod
    oc logs -n rag-pipeline-workshop -l eventing.knative.dev/source=minio-kafka-source -c dispatcher -f
    ```
    In these logs, we will see lines indicating that a message was received from Kafka and successfully sent to its "sink" (the Knative Broker).

2.  **Knative Broker & Trigger:** The Broker receives the CloudEvent and delivers it to any matching subscribers. Our `s3-event-handler` service is subscribed via a Trigger. We can verify the Trigger is ready and pointing to the correct service.
    ```bash
    oc get trigger minio-pdf-event-trigger -n rag-pipeline-workshop -o yaml
    ```
    This YAML will show that the Trigger is subscribed to the `kafka-broker` and its subscriber destination is the `kfp-s3-trigger` Knative Service.

== Step 4: The Serverless Function (`s3-event-handler`)

The final step in the eventing chain is our custom serverless function. When the Trigger fires, the Knative Broker delivers the CloudEvent to a running instance of our `s3-event-handler` pod.

The instructor will now show the logs of this pod:
```bash
# Get the name of the latest pod for the s3-event-handler service
oc get pods -n rag-pipeline-workshop -l serving.knative.dev/service=s3-event-handler

# Tail the logs of the user-container
oc logs -n rag-pipeline-workshop -l serving.knative.dev/service=s3-event-handler -c user-container -f
```

The audience will see log entries confirming:
* A POST request was received.
* The application is initializing the KFP client.
* The `list_experiments` and `list_pipelines` calls are succeeding.
* The application is logging "Submitting KFP run with name: ..."
* Finally, "KFP run successfully triggered" with a Run ID and URL.

== Step 5: The Kubeflow Pipeline Run

The event has now successfully traversed the entire serverless infrastructure and launched a data processing workflow.

1.  The instructor will navigate back to the **OpenShift AI Dashboard**.
2.  Inside the `{user}` Data Science Project, they will click on **Pipelines**.
3.  A new run will be visible at the top of the list in the **S3 Triggered PDF Runs** experiment.

Clicking on the run reveals the graph of the pipeline that was executed. We can see the `download-pdf-from-s3` and `process-pdf-with-docling` components, and by clicking on them, we can inspect their inputs, outputs, and logs.

This completes the demonstration. We have successfully shown an end-to-end, automated, and event-driven workflow for processing unstructured data on OpenShift AI.
