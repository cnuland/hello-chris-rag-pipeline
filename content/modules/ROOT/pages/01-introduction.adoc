include::_attributes.adoc[]

Welcome to the {company-name} AI Workshop! Over the next 90 minutes, we will explore how to build a powerful, event-driven https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)] system on Red Hat OpenShift AI. This lab demonstrates how to leverage modern AI/ML workflows to solve a common enterprise challenge: unlocking valuable knowledge trapped in unstructured data sources like service desk tickets and technical PDF documents.

== Your Role

For this workshop, you are an engineer on an innovative new team at *"{company-name}"*, a large multinational corporation. The company is in the midst of a digital transformation and is looking to modernize its IT support and operations by applying https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/artificial-intelligence/ai[artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies^] to improve efficiency and decision-making.

Your team's mission is to build a prototype system that proves the value of this new approach.

== The Workshop Goal

We will build a system that can:

* Automatically ingest and understand incident resolutions from a ServiceNow API.
* Process and extract knowledge from technical PDF documents in real-time.
* Power an intelligent AI assistant with this domain-specific knowledge.

By the end of this lab, you will have hands-on experience deploying the infrastructure and AI pipelines necessary to create a modern, scalable, and secure Enterprise RAG solution on OpenShift.

Let's begin by examining the specific business problem we need to solve.
