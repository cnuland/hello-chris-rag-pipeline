= 3.2 Deploying the Mock ServiceNow API
include::_attributes.adoc[]

The first step in our hands-on lab is to deploy the mock ServiceNow API. This API simulates a real ITSM system by providing endpoints that list closed incident tickets containing valuable problem-resolution data. Our Kubeflow Pipeline will connect to this API to fetch the data for ingestion into Milvus.

The deployment is managed by a declarative ArgoCD `Application` manifest, which you will apply directly using the OpenShift Web Terminal.

== Deploy the Mock API Application

1.  If you have closed it, open the *OpenShift Web Terminal* by clicking the terminal icon in the top-right corner of the web console.

2.  Copy the entire command block below. This command uses a "here document" (`<<EOF`) to pass the multi-line YAML manifest directly to the `oc apply` command.

3.  Paste the command block into the terminal and press Enter.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  # This name creates the ArgoCD application resource.
  # We are using the {user} variable to ensure it's unique for each workshop attendee.
  name: '{user}-mock-api'
  # This is the namespace where ArgoCD itself runs.
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/cnuland/hello-chris-rag-pipeline.git'
    # This path points to the kustomize directory for the mock API application.
    path: apps/api/.k8s
    targetRevision: main 
    kustomize: {}
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    # This is the workshop namespace where the API will be deployed.
    namespace: '{user}'
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ServerSideApply=true
EOF
----

After running the command, you will see the output `application.argoproj.io/{user}-mock-api created`. The GitOps operator will now begin deploying the mock API. This process may take a minute.

== Verifying the Mock API Deployment

To confirm that the API is running correctly, stay in the OpenShift Terminal and check the status of the pod in your project.

1.  Run the `oc get pods` command. You may need to run it a few times until you see the desired status.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods
----

2.  Wait until you see output similar to the following, where the `mock-api-deployment-...` pod shows a `STATUS` of `Running` and is `READY` (`1/1`).
+
[source,text]
----
NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mock-api-deployment-5f6f8b9d6c-xxxxx      1/1     Running     0          2m
----

Once the pod is running, you can proceed to the next step of verifying the API endpoints.
