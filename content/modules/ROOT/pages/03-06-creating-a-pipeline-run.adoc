= 3.6 Creating and Configuring a Pipeline Run
include::_attributes.adoc[]

With the pipeline imported, you are now ready to create a "run". A pipeline run is a single execution of the pipeline's workflow. For this pipeline, you need to provide several parameters so it knows how to connect to the mock API and the Milvus database.

== Procedure

1.  From the pipeline's details page (where you landed after the import), click the *Create run* button in the top-right corner.

2.  This will open the "Create run" page. You will need give the run a name (`simple` in the example below) and description (`Simple API to RAG pipeline`), but the most important part is the *Pipeline parameters* section at the bottom.

3.  You must fill in the following parameters to tell the pipeline how to connect to the other services running in your project. Copy the values below exactly.

* `api_endpoint`: The internal URL of the mock API you deployed.
