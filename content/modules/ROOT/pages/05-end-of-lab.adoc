== Congratulations!
:slide:

You have successfully completed the *Enterprise RAG System Workshop*!

In this lab, you have taken on the role of an engineer at {company-name} and have built a significant prototype to solve a real-world business problem.

You have successfully:

* Deployed a mock ServiceNow REST API using ArgoCD.
* Imported and configured a Data Science Pipeline in OpenShift AI.
* Executed the pipeline to automatically ingest and process data, populating a Milvus vector database.
* Queried the resulting RAG system from a Jupyter Notebook to retrieve context-aware answers from your private data.
* Explored how an event-driven architecture using Knative and Kafka can automate data ingestion in real-time.
