= 3.5 Importing the Data Science Pipeline
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that the mock API and Milvus database are running, we need to import the pipeline that connects them. A Kubeflow Pipeline can be defined in Python and then compiled into a static YAML file. This file contains the complete, portable definition of the pipeline's components and logic.

For this lab, the pipeline has already been compiled for you and is available within your pre-created workbench. Your task is to download this file and then import it into the OpenShift AI Pipelines server.

== Pipeline Import Procedure

=== Step 1: Download the Pipeline File from Your Workbench

First, we need to get the pipeline definition file from your Jupyter environment.

1.  Navigate back to the *Data Science Projects* page in the OpenShift AI dashboard and open your project.

2.  Go to the *Workbenches* tab and launch your workbench (named "My Workbench" or similar) by clicking on its name.

3.  Once JupyterLab opens, use the file browser on the left to navigate to the following path:
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
hello-chris-rag-pipeline/lab-content/3.5/
----

4.  Inside this directory, you will find the file `api_to_milvus_pipeline.yaml`. *Right-click* on the file and select *Download* from the context menu. This will save the file to your local computer (likely in your "Downloads" folder).

5.  You can now close the JupyterLab browser tab.

=== Step 2: Import the Pipeline into OpenShift AI

Now, let's upload the file you just downloaded.

1.  In the OpenShift AI dashboard, navigate to the *Pipelines* section within your Data Science Project.

2.  Click the *Import pipeline* button.

3.  In the "Import pipeline" dialog, ensure the *Upload a file* option is selected.

4.  Give your pipeline a name. For consistency, please use the name below:

[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
ServiceNow Ticket Ingestion
----

5.  (Optional) You can add a description, such as:

[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
A pipeline to fetch closed ServiceNow incidents and ingest them into a Milvus vector database.
----

6.  Click the *Upload* box and select the `api_to_milvus_pipeline.yaml` file that you just downloaded to your local machine.

7.  After selecting the file, your dialog should look like this. Click the *Import pipeline* button to finish.

With the pipeline successfully imported, we are now ready to create a run and process the data.
