= 3.4 Deploying the Milvus Vector Database
include::_attributes.adoc[]

The second major component of our RAG system is the vector database. For this workshop, we are using *Milvus*, a powerful open-source database specifically designed for storing and searching vector embeddings at scale.

Our data pipeline will populate this database with vectors generated from the ServiceNow incident tickets. You will now deploy the Milvus application into your project namespace using the OpenShift Web Terminal.

== Deploy the Milvus Application

The deployment is managed by a declarative ArgoCD `Application` manifest. You will apply this manifest directly using the `oc` command-line tool.

1.  If you have closed it from the previous step, open the *OpenShift Web Terminal* by clicking the terminal icon in the top-right corner of the web console.

2.  Copy the entire command block below. This command uses a "here document" (`<<EOF`) to pass the multi-line YAML manifest directly to the `oc apply` command.

3.  Paste the command block into the terminal and press Enter.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]

oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  # This name creates the ArgoCD application resource.
  # We are using the {user} variable to ensure it's unique for each workshop attendee.
  name: '{user}-milvus'
  # This is the namespace where ArgoCD itself runs.
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/cnuland/hello-chris-rag-pipeline.git' 
    # This path points to the kustomize directory for the Milvus service.
    path: services/milvus
    targetRevision: main 
    kustomize: {}
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    # This is the workshop namespace where Milvus will be deployed.
    namespace: '{user}'

      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ServerSideApply=true
EOF

After running the command, you will see the output `application.argoproj.io/{user}-milvus created`. The GitOps operator will now begin deploying the Milvus instance and its `etcd` dependency. This process may take a few minutes.

== Verifying the Milvus Deployment

To confirm that Milvus is running correctly, stay in the OpenShift Terminal and check the status of the pods in your project.

1.  Run the `oc get pods` command. You may need to run it a few times until you see the desired status. It may take a couple minutes for the pod to be fully available.

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n {user} -w

2.  Wait until you see output similar to the following, where both the `vectordb-etcd-0` and `vectordb-milvus-standalone` pods show a `STATUS` of `Running` and are `READY` (`1/1`).

NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mock-api-deployment-5f6f8b9d6c-xxxxx      1/1     Running     0          10m
vectordb-etcd-0                            1/1     Running     0          5m
vectordb-milvus-standalone-8566db697-v5rpf   1/1     Running     0          4m
----

With Milvus running, we now have our data source (the API) and our data destination (the vector database) ready. The next step is to import the pipeline that connects them.
