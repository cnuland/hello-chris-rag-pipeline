= 3.6 Monitoring the Pipeline Run
include::_attributes.adoc[]

After starting the pipeline run in the previous step, you were automatically taken to the run's real-time graph view. This interface is where you can monitor the progress of each component in your pipeline.

== The Run Graph View

The graph provides a live visualization of your pipeline's execution. Each box represents a component (a "task") in your pipeline.

* *Blue (Running):* A component with a blue spinning icon is currently executing.
* *Green (Succeeded):* A component with a green checkmark has completed successfully.
* *Red (Failed):* If a component encounters an error, it will turn red with an exclamation mark.

Initially, you will see the `fetch-data-from-api` component in a running state.

== Inspecting Component Logs

You can dive into each component to see its logs and details. This is essential for debugging and understanding what the pipeline is doing.

1.  *Click on the `fetch-data-from-api` component* in the graph. A side panel will open.

2.  Select the *Logs* tab. Here you can see the standard output from the component's container. You should see log lines indicating that it is connecting to the mock API and fetching the incident data.

3.  After the first component succeeds, the graph will update, and the `ingest-incidents-to-milvus` component will begin running.

4.  Click on the `ingest-incidents-to-milvus` component and view its *Logs* tab. You will see output indicating that it is:
    * Connecting to the Milvus database.
    * Loading the sentence-transformer model to generate embeddings.
    * Inserting the incident data and their vector embeddings into the Milvus collection.

== Verifying Successful Completion

The entire pipeline run should take a few minutes to complete. Once finished, both components in the graph will have green checkmarks, and the overall status of the run will be *Succeeded*.

Now that the data has been successfully processed and loaded into our vector database, we are ready to test the RAG system by querying it from a notebook.
