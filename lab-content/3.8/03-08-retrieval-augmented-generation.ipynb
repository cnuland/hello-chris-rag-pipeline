    "## Querying the RAG System with LangChain ##\n",
    "An LLM is a very capable tool, but its knowledge is limited to the public data it was trained on. It doesn't know about Parasol Company's internal IT procedures or the solutions to our past incidents. How can we make it answer questions using our specific, private data?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Full Retraining: This involves re-training the entire model from scratch with our data included. This is incredibly expensive and time-consuming, feasible for only a handful of organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-Tuning: We can \"tune\" an existing model on our data. This is much faster and cheaper. It's excellent for teaching the model a specific style, tone, or new skill, but less effective for injecting large amounts of factual knowledge. The model must also be re-tuned whenever the data is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): This is the technique we will use. We put our private knowledge into an external database (in our case, a `Milvus` vector database) and \"retrieve\" the most relevant pieces of information when a user asks a question. We then feed this retrieved context, along with the original question, to the LLM. The LLM uses this specific context to generate a highly relevant and accurate answer. This is powerful because we can continuously update our knowledge base without ever having to retrain the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous step, your data science pipeline successfully fetched closed incident tickets from our mock `ServiceNow API`, generated vector embeddings from them, and loaded them into a Milvus database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use RAG to ask questions about IT support issues and see how the LLM can provide precise answers based on the historical incident data we just ingested."

    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Retrieval**: The system searched the Milvus vector database and found the most semantically similar documents to your query using vector embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🤖 Generation**: The LLM used those retrieved documents as context to generate a specific, relevant answer based on your company's actual incident data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step process is what makes RAG so powerful - it combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the specific, up-to-date knowledge stored in your private databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits You've Just Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factual Accuracy**: The LLM's answer is grounded in real incident data, not just its training knowledge\n",
    "- **Transparency**: You can see exactly which documents influenced the answer\n",
    "- **Updatable Knowledge**: Adding new incidents to Milvus immediately makes them available for future queries\n",
    "- **Cost Effective**: No need to retrain expensive models when your data changes\n",
    "\n",
    "For Parasol Company, this means support engineers can now ask complex questions and receive answers based on the collective knowledge from thousands of past incident tickets. This is the foundation of a powerful system that can reduce resolution times, improve support consistency, and accelerate new hire training."
